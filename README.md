# Developing a Deep Learning Algorithm for Climate Change  Prediction

According to the Department of Civil Engineering and Environmental Sciences at LMU, climate change projections continue to be dominated by large uncertainties. Thanks to recent research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, in particular the success of Deep Learning algorithms to take advantage of big data, combined with the availability of Earth observations from space and from the ground, breakthroughs appear to be within reach.

In the light of the above, we propose an adaptation to the state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, used for image and audio processing, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks that will solve three problems with the current models used for climate change modeling, and prediction:

1. **Harness the power of big data:** According to field expert Andrew Ng, "A.I is the new electricity". Just like in every other major industry, the power of big data is being used to disrupt, and reinvent what is possible. Nevertheless, environmental research is yet to benefit from this advancement.

2. **Defeat the accuracy of currently used statistical and dynamical models:** We strongly believe that the recent advancements in the field, together with the wide availability of data to tackle the problem, a solution that is far better than what is out there can be achieved.

3. **Produce an algorithm that is fast and simple:** For the algorithm to be widely adopted by institutions around the wold, and in particular by developing countries, for the benefit of mankind, the program must be easy to reproduce and fast to run by anyone.
