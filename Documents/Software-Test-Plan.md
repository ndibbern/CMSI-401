### 10.1 Unit Test Plan

The unit test for Deeper Insights is the testing of the algorithm stand-alone. This testing is done on the training phase of the deep learning algorithm.

#### 10.1.1 Unit Test Description for Deeper Insight Algorithm

The following section describes tests specific to the algorithm

##### 10.1.1.1 Unit Test 1

​	Test that the algorithm improves while it is being trained.

##### 10.1.1.2 Unit Test 2

​	Test that the algorithm's error is less than 20% after the training phase is over.



### 10.2 Integration Test Plan

#### 10.2.1 Integration Test Descriptions

The following section describes tests specific to interactions with the front end and algorithms output.

#### 10.2.1.1 Integration Test 1

​	Test that the front end is displaying the correct predictions.
