# Project Proposal
## Description

According to the Department of Civil Engineering and Environmental Sciences at LMU, climate change projections continue to be dominated by large uncertainties. Thanks to recent research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, in particular the success of Deep Learning algorithms to take advantage of big data, combined with the availability of Earth observations from space and from the ground, breakthroughs appear to be within reach.

In the light of the above, we propose an adaptation to the state of the art Deep Learning algorithms, used for image and audio processing, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks that will solve three problems with the current models used for climate change modeling, and prediction:

1. **Harness the power of big data:** According to field expert Andrew Ng, "A.I is the new electricity". Just like in every other major industry, the power of big data is being used to disrupt, and reinvent what is possible. Nevertheless, environmental research is yet to benefit from this advancement.

2. **Defeat the accuracy of currently used statistical and dynamical models:** We strongly believe that the recent advancements in the field, together with the wide availability of data to tackle the problem, a solution that is far better than what is out there can be achieved.

3. **Produce an algorithm that is fast and simple:** For the algorithm to be widely adopted by institutions around the wold, and in particular by developing countries, for the benefit of mankind, the program must be easy to reproduce and fast to run by anyone.

The software solution developed in this project is aimed to be adopted worldwide. First by research institutions, and later by governments, Nonprofit organizations, and individuals, who might benefit from its predictions. Applications include prediction and prevention of natural disasters produced by global warming.

## Justification

We believe this project allows both team members to exercise the lessons and tools gained at Loyola Marymount University as well as through individual experiences outside of academics.

We will be implementing our frontend education, gained through Interaction Design, to create a user-friendly interface for individuals who have little experience with machine learning applications. We will also be able to use what we have learned in Intro to Database Systems course to store and handle big collections of information "Big Data."

The project also relies heavily in the concepts acquired by both team members in LMU's Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning courses. The biggest and more challenging aspect of the project comes down to using the algorithms and concepts form those classes in a practical scenario with great potential.

Finally the project leaves room for both members to grow and learn; for instance none of the team members have ever worked in collaboration with a department outside LMU's Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. We will not only need to exercise good communication, but also we must learn the concepts and skills that are key for a project in the Environmental Sciences to succeed.

We are all excited by the opportunity to learn about Environmental Science and Deep Learning interaction, as well as project management and development using the Agile methodologies. We also hope to be able to provide a product that promotes safety to countries facing the consequences of global warming.
