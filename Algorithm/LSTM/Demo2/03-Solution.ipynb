       "'Mansfield Park , in its second half , is my favorite of Austen \\'s novels , and Fanny Price my favorite of her heroines , so I \\'m saddened by the unhappy fate she \\'s suffered in her <unk> and small - screen representations . The only good reading of the character I \\'ve heard was done for radio by Amanda Root , who gave it the same quality as she did the character Anne in the film of \" <unk> \" : a stern , sure , heartfelt moral <unk> . If the actress had been younger she would have been good visual casting as well ; but the <unk> that have reached our eyes to date have more resembled , respectively : Mary Crawford ; Ruby the <unk> girl ; and ( in this incarnation ) a jovial serving wench , or possibly tart , with her high moral principles pulled down a <unk> /><br />Well , I had hoped for better , but had feared worse . The serial had a solid Edmund , in an actor who was best at likable saps , and the perfect , i.e. perfectly abominable , Mrs. Norris ; otherwise it was <unk> . The film , which was apparently intended as a deconstruction or some other bad theatrical idea , came off as a mixed - up burlesque . After such disappointments , and the more recent disappointments of this production \\'s sister pieces ( the new \" <unk> \" and \" <unk> Abbey \" ) , I could n\\'t help but have mixed expectations for this one ; and on the whole , it left me feeling slightly better disposed to it than not . It condensed the novel intelligently , and in the end left me with much the same feeling , as a comic - book version might . On the other hand , to do so it had to <unk> most of the characters , except the <unk> , and it incidentally diminished or eliminated most or all of the most memorable things in the book , including its most famous character and what should be , if it is n\\'t , its most famous scene.<br /><br />The character is the <unk> Aunt Norris , always ready to direct other people in what to do , but always managing to avoid having to do any of it herself ; here one gets no sense of that at all . And with her goes much else : her remark that cuts through Fanny , \" ... considering who and what you are \" ; Sir Thomas \\'s discovery that she has forbidden Fanny a fire in her room all these years , and his <unk> apology for her ; Fanny \\'s honesty in <unk> , during a visit home , that Aunt Norris , for all her faults , could manage the household better than either of her sisters . But then , that entire trip is missing from the story , and so is most of what goes on at the theatrical <unk> and most of what <unk> Sir Thomas on his return ; and in fact Sir Thomas himself , and his wife , are different from what they were . Above all , the scene in which Crawford proposes to Fanny , one of Austen \\'s most complex , is simplified to a bare telling ; missing from it is Fanny \\'s staunch <unk> of what she knows to be right , and what she knows to be very probably true , against all the distractions Crawford and anybody else can throw at her . To a male reader , now no less than when it was written , it reveals with <unk> clarity -- <unk> , at any rate , as far as I know -- what a woman goes through in trying to deal fairly but firmly with a man she has reason to distrust . It \\'s a brilliant scene , in the novel ; on TV it \\'s just a scene.<br /><br />And , Fanny , oh , Fanny : when will we see your like ?'"
